## Node.js

- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
- Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

## NPM

- npm is the package manager for JavaScript and the worldâ€™s largest software registry.
- npm consists of a command line client that interacts with a remote registry.

## Modules

- A module encapsulates related code into a single unit of code.
- A module can be included in other modules using `require` function.
- Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.

## Events

- Events in Node.js are actions or occurrences that happen in the system.
- Node.js has a built-in module, `events`, where you can create-, fire-, and listen for- your own events.

## File System

- Node.js includes `fs` module to work with the file system.
- The `fs` module provides file I/O operations using simple wrappers around standard POSIX functions.

## HTTP

- Node.js has a built-in module, `http`, which allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
- Node.js has a built-in module, `https`, which allows Node.js to transfer data over secure Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTPS).

## Express

- Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features.

## RESTful API

- REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
- A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

## MongoDB

- MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program.
- Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

## Mongoose

- Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

## Authentication

- Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user.
- Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js.

## Authorization

- Authorization is the process of determining if a user has permission to perform a certain action.
- Role based access control (RBAC) is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users.

## Validation

- Validation is the process of ensuring that data is both correct and secure.
- Joi is a powerful schema description language and data validator for JavaScript.

## Unit Testing

- Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.
- Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

## Integration Testing

- Integration testing is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group.
- Supertest is a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP.

## Test Driven Development

- Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle.
- TDD is a programming technique that involves writing tests before writing the actual code.

## Deployment

- Deployment is the process of making a software system available for use.
- Heroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages.

## Security

- Security is the degree of resistance to, or protection from, harm.
- Helmet helps secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.

## Performance

- Performance is a measure of how quickly a system performs a certain process or transaction.
- PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications with a built-in load balancer.

## Scalability

- Scalability is the capability of a system to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to accommodate growth.
- Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources.

## Design Patterns

- Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design.
- Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

## Error Handling

- Error handling is the process of responding to and recovering from error conditions in a program.
- Express has a default error handler, but you can also define custom error handlers.

## Logging

- Logging is the process of recording events that happen in an application.
- Winston is a versatile logging library for Node.js.

## Debugging

- Debugging is the process of finding and resolving defects or problems within a computer program.
- Node.js has a built-in debugging interface.

## Monitoring

- Monitoring is the process of observing and checking the progress or quality of a program over time.
- PM2 provides a monitoring feature.

## CI/CD

- Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
- Continuous Deployment (CD) is a strategy for software releases wherein any code commit that passes the automated testing phase is automatically released into the production environment.

## Docker

- Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
- A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run a piece of software.

## Microservices

- Microservices is a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.
- Each service is self-contained and should implement a single business capability.

## GraphQL

- GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data.
- GraphQL is a specification for how to communicate with APIs.

## Websockets

- WebSockets is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
- Socket.IO enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.

## TypeScript

- TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.
- TypeScript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.

## ES6

- ECMAScript 6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the latest version of the ECMAScript standard.
- ES6 includes significant enhancements to the language, such as arrow functions, classes, template literals, and let + const.

## Best Practices

- Best practices are a set of guidelines, ethics or ideas that represent the most efficient or prudent course of action.
- Node.js best practices include error-first callbacks, event emitters, streams, and middleware.
